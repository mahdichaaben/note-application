This is a simple notes application developed as a learning project to understand Node.js backend development using the Express framework. The application allows users to store their notes after authentication and provides basic CRUD functionality.

Date of Creation: June/July 2022

## Authentication

User authentication in this application is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and cookies. Upon successful authentication, users receive a JWT token which is then stored in a cookie for subsequent requests. This token is used to verify the user's identity and grant access to protected routes, such as creating, updating, and deleting notes.
