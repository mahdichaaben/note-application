## Authentication

User authentication in this application is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and cookies. Upon successful authentication, users receive a JWT token which is then stored in a cookie for subsequent requests. This token is used to verify the user's identity and grant access to protected routes, such as creating, updating, and deleting notes.
